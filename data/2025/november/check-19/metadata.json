For each, confirm a Notice of Default Sums (NODS) was generated when required and within statutory timeframes, that the content matches the prescribed form (correct balances, sums, mandatory wording/info sheet where applicable), and that figures reconcile to the system ledger. Check no collection/enforcement activity relied on amounts before a compliant notice was issued. Save PDF copies or system renders of the notice, the event/trigger logs, and the account transaction history as evidence.",
